# MNIST Digit Classification

This is a complete neural network implementation in plain C++ to solve the MNIST handwritten digit classification problem.

Run `make` to build the executable, then `make train` to begin training/testing. Use `make run` to run the prediction service using a [Crow](https://crowcpp.org/) server.
